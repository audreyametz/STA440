# STA440

Strategy: Build out and reduce linear regression and run diagnostics. Repeat but with robust regression. Using diagnostics, choose which model is more appropriate. Smoking will be a binary variable. 

Interim report: 
•	Describe your process for model selection and validation (including choice of using robust model if normal regression is determined to be inaccurate) (Naya, AJ, Faraz*)
•	Interpret associations between each predictor and birth weight in, including characterization of uncertainty (?) (describe meaning of the slope for each predictor) (Audreya)
•	Edit/review/combine and check for reproducibility Include diagnostic plots (Moriah)

Details 
•	5 pages (maximum) report using R markdown
•	Code should be fully reproducible
•	File size is limited to 50mb

*Faraz, connect with Naya and AJ for details.
